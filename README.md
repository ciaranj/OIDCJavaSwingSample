OIDCJavaSwingSample
===================

Sample  demonstrating Java Swing/SWT Browser launch to authenticate against an OIDC provider such as ThinkTecture.IdentityServer.v3

Be very careful if you are working against https://github.com/thinktecture/Thinktecture.IdentityServer.v3 that you pay attention to 
https://github.com/thinktecture/Thinktecture.IdentityServer.v3/issues/266 as if this hasn't been addressed in your version this code
will not work! (you will need to apply the suggested workaround to make it work)
